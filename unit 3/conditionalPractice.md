## Python Conditional Logic Practice
<b>Inside of the conditionalLogic.py document you created yesterday. Answer the following python conditional questions. </b>

<i> Guided coding with instructor</i>
1. You have been hired as an engineer to develop a discount function for 
technology store that is going out of business. Since the store is 
going out of business they are selling everything at significant 
deals and discounts. Your function should take in an integer as an 
argument. This number will represent the number of items the shopper is
buying. If the the number passed into the function is greater than or
equal to 3, the function should print out "congrats you will get 50% off of your purchase". Otherwise, the function should print out: "congrats, you will get 25% off of your purchase".

<i> Independent coding - 15 minutes and then review</i>

2. You have been hired as a software engineer to assist a movie theater company. with developing a pricing function based on a moviegoer's age. 
Your function should take in an integer as an argument. The number will
represent the moviegoer's age. If the moviegoer's age is greater than or equal to 50, your program should print a message saying "your movie ticket is half price". Otherwise, your program should print out "your movie ticket is full price".

<i> Guided coding with instructor instructor- introduce elif keyword</i> 

3. You have been hired by boy's Latin to develop a quiz function 
fora school. The school has specified that the quiz should 
have two questions, which will be provided below. When 
the quiz function takes two string arguments. The two string arguments,
are the user's quiz answers. If both answers passed into the function

gets only one of the answers correct, the quiz should print out that they failed. 

Quiz questions:
a. What is the capital of Pennsylvania ?

b. How many national Parks are in Pennsylvania ? 

<b>Hint: You will need to use one of the logical operators. </b>

4. Boys Latin Middle school has asked you to develop a function that will
will allow students to enter a letter and the program will determine if 
it is a vowel or not a vowel. Your function should include a input function in order to take in a string letter. and then, using the conditional if/ else

keywords to determine if the letter is a vowel or not.

<u>example:</u>

if a user enters the letter "a", it should print out the message: 
"this is a vowel". Else it is any letter or character that is
