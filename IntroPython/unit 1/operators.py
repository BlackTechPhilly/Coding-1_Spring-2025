# Data manipulation  - Operators

# In python we have operators, that 
# allow us to change data.

# Assignment operators
# assignment opperators use some combination of the equal
# to give a variable a value.

name = 'Ian' # the equal sign is the operator
willItSnow = True
numberOfSandwiches = 10
bankAccount = 10000


laptopDell= 1000

# Comparison operators
# comparisons operators allow us to evaluate data
# based on several factors

10 < 20 # is 10 less than 20 

20.34 >= 0  # is 20.34 greater than or equal to 0

100 == 100 # is 100 the SAME AS 100

100 != 10 # is 100 NOT the SAME AS 10

# Arithmatic operators
# the arithmatic operators allow us to perform
# math with- specifically with the integer and float
# data types

10 + 10 # addition
12 - 2 # subtraction
10 * 8 # multiplication
2 / 1 # division

# Logical operators
# we use logical operators to evaluate if data is true
# or false

password = '123'
securityQuestion = 'Franks'

mathAnswer = 4
# and - used to compare to conditions that are both true

# if both conditions below are true, we will have the value
# of true

password == '123' and 4 == mathAnswer

# or - used to compare conditions, But only one needs to 
# to be true in order for the output to be true. 

password == '123' or 2+3 == mathAnswer

# not - used to compare conditions, BUT will
# output the opposite result- meaning if two things are true,
# we are going to get false

# whatever the real result is, will become the opposite
not(password == '123' and 2+2 == mathAnswer)
