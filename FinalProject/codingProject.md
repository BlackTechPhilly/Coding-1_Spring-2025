## Python Coding Project

<b>Objective</b>

Create a custom Python function that solves a small problem, completes a task, or performs a fun action using what you've learned about functions.


<b>Instructions</b>

Design a small function that completes a simple task. Some example include:

* NOTE: Your function must be approved by the instructor. Unless approved by the instructor you cannot do these examples.

- Returns or Prints out some data
- Must use operators, conditional statements and a type of loop. 

<b>Submission Steps</b>
